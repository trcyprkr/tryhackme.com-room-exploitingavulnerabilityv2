Exploiting Vulnerabilities Task 5

For some reason, this one was difficult for me.  Then I decided, easiest first.

So, here's my method.

Visited wesite

ran nmap scan -sC --script=vuln on port 80

found an interesting php page and navigated there

on the fly tried a common U/P, U: ***** P: ********

gained access

added 'bootstrap/img' to the url path

gained access to files in 'img' folder

found 'flag.txt' and opened the link

found flag text and completed the challenge

THM{************} 

I was trying to make it harder than it was.

Hope this is helpful.
